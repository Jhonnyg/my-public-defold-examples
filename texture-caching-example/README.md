# Texture caching example

This example shows how to use the resource.create_texture and resource.set_texture together with basis compressed data. As it's just an educational project, It's not exactly production ready code and I won't exactly make any changes :)

* Defold 1.4.2 is required for this to run
* Source textures are taken from https://screamingbrainstudios.com/dl-tiny-texture-pack-2/
* The textures are generated by our own texconvert tool from the Defold repo: https://github.com/defold/defold/tree/dev/engine/tools/src/texconvert but it should be possible to use the official basisu encoders (https://github.com/BinomialLLC/basis_universal) or you could modify the source to use other image formats
* _I've only tested this on mac!_
